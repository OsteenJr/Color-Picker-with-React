# Color-Picker-with-React
Built a color picker with React
Implemented a functional React component called ColorPicker that allows users to select a color using an input of type color. The selected color is displayed in real time both as a background and as hex text. Used React state (useState) to handle color changes dynamically. Styled using classNames.
